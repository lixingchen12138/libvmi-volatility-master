.PP
\&\fBvirsh\fR [\fI\s-1OPTION\s0\fR]... \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR [\fI\s-1ARG\s0\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBvirsh\fR program is the main interface for managing virsh guest
domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and shutdown
domains. It can also be used to list current domains. Libvirt is a C
toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent
versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software available
under the \s-1GNU\s0 Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of the
Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of
Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the
basic resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aims at
providing a long term stable C \s-1API. \s0 It currently supports Xen, \s-1QEMU,
KVM, LXC,\s0 OpenVZ, VirtualBox and VMware \s-1ESX.\s0
.PP
The basic structure of most virsh usage is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  virsh [OPTION]... <command> <domain> [ARG]...
.Ve
.PP
Where \fIcommand\fR is one of the commands listed below; \fIdomain\fR is the
numeric domain id, or the domain name, or the domain \s-1UUID\s0; and \fI\s-1ARGS\s0\fR
are command specific options.  There are a few exceptions to this rule
in the cases where the command in question acts on all domains, the
entire machine, or directly on the xen hypervisor.  Those exceptions
will be clear for each of those commands.  Note: it is permissible to
give numeric names to domains, however, doing so will result in a
domain that can only be identified by domain id. In other words, if a
numeric value is supplied it will be interpreted as a domain id, not
as a name.
.PP
The \fBvirsh\fR program can be used either to run one \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR by giving the
command and its arguments on the shell command line, or a \fI\s-1COMMAND_STRING\s0\fR
which is a single shell argument consisting of multiple \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR actions
and their arguments joined with whitespace, and separated by semicolons
between commands.  Within \fI\s-1COMMAND_STRING\s0\fR, virsh understands the
same single, double, and backslash escapes as the shell, although you must
add another layer of shell escaping in creating the single shell argument.
If no command is given in the command line, \fBvirsh\fR will then start a minimal
interpreter waiting for your commands, and the \fBquit\fR command will then exit
the program.
.PP
The \fBvirsh\fR program understands the following \fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-connect\fR \fI\s-1URI\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --connect URI"
Connect to the specified \fI\s-1URI\s0\fR, as if by the \fBconnect\fR command,
instead of the default connection.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --debug LEVEL"
Enable debug messages at integer \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR and above.  \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR can
range from 0 to 4 (default).  See the documentation of \fB\s-1VIRSH_DEBUG\s0\fR
environment variable below for the description of each \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-escape\fR \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --escape string"
Set alternative escape sequence for \fIconsole\fR command. By default,
telnet's \fB^]\fR is used. Allowed characters when using hat notation are:
alphabetic character, @, [, ], \e, ^, _.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Ignore all other arguments, and behave as if the \fBhelp\fR command were
given instead.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keepalive\-interval\fR \fI\s-1INTERVAL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k, --keepalive-interval INTERVAL"
Set an \fI\s-1INTERVAL\s0\fR (in seconds) for sending keepalive messages to
check whether connection to the server is still alive.  Setting the
interval to 0 disables client keepalive mechanism.
.IP "\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-keepalive\-count\fR \fI\s-1COUNT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-K, --keepalive-count COUNT"
Set a number of times keepalive message can be sent without getting an
answer from the server without marking the connection dead.  There is
no effect to this setting in case the \fI\s-1INTERVAL\s0\fR is set to 0.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --log FILE"
Output logging details to \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Avoid extra informational messages.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-readonly\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --readonly"
Make the initial connection read-only, as if by the \fI\-\-readonly\fR
option of the \fBconnect\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t, --timing"
Output elapsed time information for each command.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version[=short]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --version[=short]"
Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library
virsh is coming from
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version=long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version=long"
Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library
virsh is coming from and which options and driver are compiled in.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
Most \fBvirsh\fR operations rely upon the libvirt library being able to
connect to an already running libvirtd service.  This can usually be
done using the command \fBservice libvirtd start\fR.
.PP
Most \fBvirsh\fR commands require root privileges to run due to the
communications channels used to talk to the hypervisor.  Running as
non root will return an error.
.PP
Most \fBvirsh\fR commands act synchronously, except maybe shutdown,
setvcpus and setmem. In those cases the fact that the \fBvirsh\fR
program returned, may not mean the action is complete and you
must poll periodically to detect that the guest completed the
operation.
.PP
\&\fBvirsh\fR strives for backward compatibility.  Although the \fBhelp\fR
command only lists the preferred usage of a command, if an older
version of \fBvirsh\fR supported an alternate spelling of a command or
option (such as \fI\-\-tunnelled\fR instead of \fI\-\-tunneled\fR), then
scripts using that older spelling will continue to work.
.PP
Several \fBvirsh\fR commands take an optionally scaled integer; if no
scale is provided, then the default is listed in the command (for
historical reasons, some commands default to bytes, while other
commands default to kibibytes).  The following case-insensitive
suffixes can be used to select a specific scale:
  b, byte  byte      1
  \s-1KB      \s0 kilobyte  1,000
  k, KiB   kibibyte  1,024
  \s-1MB      \s0 megabyte  1,000,000
  M, MiB   mebibyte  1,048,576

Allows you to display or set the node memory parameters.
\&\fIshm-pages-to-scan\fR can be used to set the number of pages to scan
before the shared memory service goes to sleep; \fIshm-sleep-millisecs\fR
can be used to set the number of millisecs the shared memory service should
sleep before next scan; \fIshm-merge-across-nodes\fR specifies if pages from
different numa nodes can be merged. When set to 0, only pages which physically
reside in the memory area of same \s-1NUMA\s0 node can be merged. When set to 1,
pages from all nodes can be merged. Default to 1.
.Sp
\&\fBNote\fR: Currently the \*(L"shared memory service\*(R" only means \s-1KSM \s0(Kernel Samepage
Merging).
.IP "\fBcapabilities\fR" 4
.IX Item "capabilities"
Print an \s-1XML\s0 document describing the capabilities of the hypervisor
we are currently connected to. This includes a section on the host
capabilities in terms of \s-1CPU\s0 and features, and a set of description
for each kind of guest which can be virtualized. For a more complete
description see:
  <http://libvirt.org/formatcaps.html>
The \s-1XML\s0 also show the \s-1NUMA\s0 topology information if available.
.IP "\fBdomcapabilities\fR [\fIvirttype\fR] [\fIemulatorbin\fR] [\fIarch\fR] [\fImachine\fR]" 4
.IX Item "domcapabilities [virttype] [emulatorbin] [arch] [machine]"
Print an \s-1XML\s0 document describing the domain capabilities for the
hypervisor we are connected to using information either sourced from an
existing domain or taken from the \fBvirsh capabilities\fR output. This may
be useful if you intend to create a new domain and are curious if for
instance it could make use of \s-1VFIO\s0 by creating a domain for the
hypervisor with a specific emulator and architecture.
.Sp
Each hypervisor will have different requirements regarding which options
are required and which are optional. A hypervisor can support providing
a default value for any of the options.
.Sp
The \fIvirttype\fR option specifies the virtualization type used. The value
to be used is either from the 'type' attribute of the <domain/> top
level element from the domain \s-1XML\s0 or the 'type' attribute found within
each <guest/> element from the \fBvirsh capabilities\fR output.  The
\&\fIemulatorbin\fR option specifies the path to the emulator. The value to
be used is either the <emulator> element in the domain \s-1XML\s0 or the
\&\fBvirsh capabilities\fR output. The \fIarch\fR option specifies the
architecture to be used for the domain. The value to be used is either
the \*(L"arch\*(R" attribute from the domain's \s-1XML\s0 <os/> element and <type/>
subelement or the \*(L"name\*(R" attribute of an <arch/> element from the
\&\fBvirsh capabililites\fR output. The \fImachine\fR specifies the machine type
for the emulator. The value to be used is either the \*(L"machine\*(R" attribute
from the domain's \s-1XML\s0 <os/> element and <type/> subelement or one from a
list of machines from the \fBvirsh capabilities\fR output for a specific
architecture and domain type.
.Sp
For the qemu hypervisor, a \fIvirttype\fR of either 'qemu' or 'kvm' must be
supplied along with either the \fIemulatorbin\fR or \fIarch\fR in order to
generate output for the default \fImachine\fR.  Supplying a \fImachine\fR
value will generate output for the specific machine.
.IP "\fBinject-nmi\fR \fIdomain\fR" 4

An example format for the list is as follows:
.Sp
\&\fBvirsh\fR list
  Id    Name                           State

.Sp
Name is the name of the domain.  \s-1ID\s0 the domain numeric id.
State is the run state (see below).
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1STATES\s0\fR
.Sp
The State field lists 8 states for a domain, and which ones the
current domain is in.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBcpu-models\fR \fIarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "cpu-models arch"
Print the list of \s-1CPU\s0 models known for the specified architecture.
.IP "\fBrunning\fR" 4
.IX Item "running"
The domain is currently running on a \s-1CPU\s0
.IP "\fBidle\fR" 4
.IX Item "idle"
The domain is idle, and not running or runnable.  This can be caused
because the domain is waiting on \s-1IO \s0(a traditional wait state) or has
gone to sleep because there was nothing else for it to do.
.IP "\fBpaused\fR" 4
.IX Item "paused"
The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator
running \fBvirsh suspend\fR.  When in a paused state the domain will still
consume allocated resources like memory, but will not be eligible for
scheduling by the hypervisor.
.IP "\fBshutdown\fR" 4
.IX Item "shutdown"
The domain is in the process of shutting down, i.e. the guest operating system
has been notified and should be in the process of stopping its operations
gracefully.
.IP "\fBshut off\fR" 4
.IX Item "shut off"
The domain is not running.  Usually this indicates the domain has been
shut down completely, or has not been started.
.IP "\fBcrashed\fR" 4
.IX Item "crashed"
The domain has crashed, which is always a violent ending.  Usually
this state can only occur if the domain has been configured not to
restart on crash.
.IP "\fBdying\fR" 4
.IX Item "dying"
The domain is in process of dying, but hasn't completely shutdown or
crashed.
.IP "\fBpmsuspended\fR" 4
.IX Item "pmsuspended"
The domain has been suspended by guest power management, e.g. entered
into s3 state.
.RE

.Sp
Normally only active domains are listed. To list inactive domains specify
\&\fI\-\-inactive\fR or \fI\-\-all\fR to list both active and inactive domains.
.Sp
To further filter the list of domains you may specify one or more of filtering
flags supported by the \fBlist\fR command. These flags are grouped by function.
Specifying one or more flags from a group enables the filter group. Note that
some combinations of flags may yield no results. Supported filtering flags and
groups:
.IP "\fBPersistence\fR" 4
.IX Item "Persistence"
Flag \fI\-\-persistent\fR is used to include persistent domains in the returned
list. To include transient domains specify \fI\-\-transient\fR.
.IP "\fBExistence of managed save image\fR" 4
.IX Item "Existence of managed save image"
To list domains having a managed save image specify flag
\&\fI\-\-with\-managed\-save\fR. For domains that don't have a managed save image
specify \fI\-\-without\-managed\-save\fR.
.IP "\fBDomain state\fR" 4
.IX Item "Domain state"
The following filter flags select a domain by its state:
\&\fI\-\-state\-running\fR for running domains, \fI\-\-state\-paused\fR  for paused domains,
\&\fI\-\-state\-shutoff\fR for turned off domains and \fI\-\-state\-other\fR for all
other states as a fallback.
.IP "\fBAutostarting domains\fR" 4
.IX Item "Autostarting domains"
To list autostarting domains use the flag \fI\-\-autostart\fR. To list domains with
this feature disabled use \fI\-\-no\-autostart\fR.
.IP "\fBSnapshot existence\fR" 4
.IX Item "Snapshot existence"
Domains that have snapshot images can be listed using flag \fI\-\-with\-snapshot\fR,
domains without a snapshot \fI\-\-without\-snapshot\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of \s-1API\s0
calls with an inherent race, where a domain might not be listed or might appear
more than once if it changed state between calls while the list was being
collected.  Newer servers do not have this problem.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-managed\-save\fR is specified, then domains that have managed save state
(only possible if they are in the \fBshut off\fR state, so you need to specify
\&\fI\-\-inactive\fR or \fI\-\-all\fR to actually list them) will instead show as \fBsaved\fR
in the listing. This flag is usable only with the default \fI\-\-table\fR output.
Note that this flag does not filter the list of domains.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-name\fR is specified, domain names are printed instead of the table
formatted one per line. If \fI\-\-uuid\fR is specified domain's \s-1UUID\s0's are printed
instead of names. Flag \fI\-\-table\fR specifies that the legacy table-formatted
output should be used. This is the default. All of these are mutually
exclusive.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-title\fR is specified, then the short domain description (title) is
printed in an extra column. This flag is usable only with the default
\&\fI\-\-table\fR output.
.Sp
Example:

.IX Item "freecell [{ [--cellno] cellno | --all }]"
Prints the available amount of memory on the machine or within a \s-1NUMA\s0
cell.  The freecell command can provide one of three different
displays of available memory on the machine depending on the options
specified.  With no options, it displays the total free memory on the
machine.  With the \-\-all option, it displays the free memory in each
cell and the total free memory on the machine.  Finally, with a
numeric argument or with \-\-cellno plus a cell number it will display
the free memory for the specified cell only.

.IX Item "freepages [{ [--cellno] cellno [--pagesize] pagesize | --all }]"
Prints the available amount of pages within a \s-1NUMA\s0 cell. \fIcellno\fR refers
to the \s-1NUMA\s0 cell you're interested in. \fIpagesize\fR is a scaled integer (see
\&\fB\s-1NOTES\s0\fR above).  Alternatively, if \fI\-\-all\fR is used, info on each possible
combination of \s-1NUMA\s0 cell and page size is printed out.

.IX Item "allocpages [--pagesize] pagesize [--pagecount] pagecount [[--cellno] cellno] [--add] [--all]"
Change the size of pages pool of \fIpagesize\fR on the host. If
\&\fI\-\-add\fR is specified, then \fIpagecount\fR pages are added into the
pool. However, if \fI\-\-add\fR wasn't specified, then the
\&\fIpagecount\fR is taken as the new absolute size of the pool (this
may be used to free some pages and size the pool down). The
\&\fIcellno\fR modifier can be used to narrow the modification down to
a single host \s-1NUMA\s0 cell. On the other end of spectrum lies
\&\fI\-\-all\fR which executes the modification on all \s-1NUMA\s0 cells.
.IP "\fBcpu-baseline\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR [\fI\-\-features\fR]" 4
.IX Item "cpu-baseline FILE [--features]"
Compute baseline \s-1CPU\s0 which will be supported by all host CPUs given in <file>.
The list of host CPUs is built by extracting all <cpu> elements from the
<file>. Thus, the <file> can contain either a set of <cpu> elements separated
by new lines or even a set of complete <capabilities> elements printed by
\&\fBcapabilities\fR command.  If \fI\-\-features\fR is specified then the
resulting \s-1XML\s0 description will explicitly include all features that make
up the \s-1CPU,\s0 without this option features that are part of the \s-1CPU\s0 model
will not be listed in the \s-1XML\s0 description.
.IP "\fBcpu-compare\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR [\fI\-\-error\fR]" 4
.IX Item "cpu-compare FILE [--error]"
Compare \s-1CPU\s0 definition from \s-1XML\s0 <file> with host \s-1CPU.\s0 The \s-1XML\s0 <file> may
contain either host or guest \s-1CPU\s0 definition. The host \s-1CPU\s0 definition is the
<cpu> element and its contents as printed by \fBcapabilities\fR command. The
guest \s-1CPU\s0 definition is the <cpu> element and its contents from domain \s-1XML\s0
definition. For more information on guest \s-1CPU\s0 definition see:
<http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU>. If \fI\-\-error\fR is

incompatible with host \s-1CPU\s0 and a message providing more details about the
incompatibility will be printed out.
.IP "\fBecho\fR [\fI\-\-shell\fR] [\fI\-\-xml\fR] [\fIarg\fR...]" 4

.IP "\fBconsole\fR \fIdomain\fR [\fIdevname\fR] [\fI\-\-safe\fR] [\fI\-\-force\fR]" 4
.IX Item "console domain [devname] [--safe] [--force]"
Connect the virtual serial console for the guest. The optional
\&\fIdevname\fR parameter refers to the device alias of an alternate
console, serial or parallel device configured for the guest.
If omitted, the primary console will be opened.
.Sp
If the flag \fI\-\-safe\fR is specified, the connection is only attempted
if the driver supports safe console handling. This flag specifies that
the server has to ensure exclusive access to console devices. Optionally
the \fI\-\-force\fR flag may be specified, requesting to disconnect any existing
sessions, such as in a case of a broken connection.
.IP "\fBcreate\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR [\fI\-\-console\fR] [\fI\-\-paused\fR] [\fI\-\-autodestroy\fR] [\fI\-\-pass\-fds N,M,...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "create FILE [--console] [--paused] [--autodestroy] [--pass-fds N,M,...]"
Create a domain from an \s-1XML\s0 <file>. An easy way to create the \s-1XML\s0
<file> is to use the \fBdumpxml\fR command to obtain the definition of a
pre-existing guest.  The domain will be paused if the \fI\-\-paused\fR option
is used and supported by the driver; otherwise it will be running.
If \fI\-\-console\fR is requested, attach to the console after creation.
If \fI\-\-autodestroy\fR is requested, then the guest will be automatically
destroyed when virsh closes its connection to libvirt, or otherwise
exits.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-pass\-fds\fR is specified, the argument is a comma separated list
of open file descriptors which should be pass on into the guest. The
file descriptors will be re-numbered in the guest, starting from 3. This

.IX Item "desc domain [[--live] [--config] | [--current]] [--title] [--edit] [--new-desc New description or title message]"
Show or modify description and title of a domain. These values are user
fields that allow to store arbitrary textual data to allow easy
identification of domains. Title should be short, although it's not enforced.
(See also \fBmetadata\fR that works with \s-1XML\s0 based domain metadata.)
.Sp
Flags \fI\-\-live\fR or \fI\-\-config\fR select whether this command works on live
or persistent definitions of the domain. If both \fI\-\-live\fR and \fI\-\-config\fR
are specified, the \fI\-\-config\fR option takes precedence on getting the current
description and both live configuration and config are updated while setting
the description. \fI\-\-current\fR is exclusive and implied if none of these was
specified.
.Sp
Flag \fI\-\-edit\fR specifies that an editor with the contents of current
description or title should be opened and the contents saved back afterwards.
.Sp
Flag \fI\-\-title\fR selects operation on the title field instead of description.
.Sp
If neither of \fI\-\-edit\fR and \fI\-\-new\-desc\fR are specified the note or description
is displayed instead of being modified.
.IP "\fBdestroy\fR \fIdomain\fR [\fI\-\-graceful\fR]" 4
.IX Item "destroy domain [--graceful]"
Immediately terminate the domain \fIdomain\fR.  This doesn't give the domain
\&\s-1OS\s0 any chance to react, and it's the equivalent of ripping the power
cord out on a physical machine.  In most cases you will want to use
the \fBshutdown\fR command instead.  However, this does not delete any
storage volumes used by the guest, and if the domain is persistent, it
can be restarted later.
.Sp
If \fIdomain\fR is transient, then the metadata of any snapshots will
be lost once the guest stops running, but the snapshot contents still
exist, and a new domain with the same name and \s-1UUID\s0 can restore the
snapshot metadata with \fBsnapshot-create\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-graceful\fR is specified, don't resort to extreme measures
(e.g. \s-1SIGKILL\s0) when the guest doesn't stop after a reasonable timeout;
return an error instead.

.IX Item "domblkstat domain [block-device] [--human]"
Get device block stats for a running domain.  A \fIblock-device\fR corresponds
to a unique target name (<target dev='name'/>) or source file (<source
file='name'/>) for one of the disk devices attached to \fIdomain\fR (see
also \fBdomblklist\fR for listing these names). On a lxc domain, omitting the

Reduce the length of a backing image chain, by committing changes at the
top of the chain (snapshot or delta files) into backing images.  By
default, this command attempts to flatten the entire chain.  If \fIbase\fR
and/or \fItop\fR are specified as files within the backing chain, then the
operation is constrained to committing just that portion of the chain;
\&\fI\-\-shallow\fR can be used instead of \fIbase\fR to specify the immediate
backing file of the resulting top image to be committed.  The files
being committed are rendered invalid, possibly as soon as the operation
starts; using the \fI\-\-delete\fR flag will attempt to remove these invalidated
files at the successful completion of the commit operation. When the
\&\fI\-\-keep\-relative\fR flag is used, the backing file paths will be kept relative.
.Sp
When \fItop\fR is omitted or specified as the active image, it is also
possible to specify \fI\-\-active\fR to trigger a two-phase active commit. In
the first phase, \fItop\fR is copied into \fIbase\fR and the job can only be
canceled, with top still containing data not yet in base. In the second
phase, \fItop\fR and \fIbase\fR remain identical until a call to \fBblockjob\fR
with the \fI\-\-abort\fR flag (keeping top as the active image that tracks
changes from that point in time) or the \fI\-\-pivot\fR flag (making base
the new active image and invalidating top).
.Sp
By default, this command returns as soon as possible, and data for
the entire disk is committed in the background; the progress of the
operation can be checked with \fBblockjob\fR.  However, if \fI\-\-wait\fR is
specified, then this command will block until the operation completes
(or for \fI\-\-active\fR, enters the second phase), or until the operation
is canceled because the optional \fItimeout\fR in seconds elapses
or \s-1SIGINT\s0 is sent (usually with \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl\-C\*(C'\fR).  Using \fI\-\-verbose\fR along
with \fI\-\-wait\fR will produce periodic status updates.  If job cancellation
is triggered, \fI\-\-async\fR will return control to the user as fast as
possible, otherwise the command may continue to block a little while
longer until the job is done cleaning up.  Using \fI\-\-pivot\fR is shorthand
for combining \fI\-\-active\fR \fI\-\-wait\fR with an automatic \fBblockjob\fR
\&\fI\-\-pivot\fR; and using \fI\-\-keep\-overlay\fR is shorthand for combining

Copy a disk backing image chain to a destination.  Either \fIdest\fR as
the destination file name, or \fIxml\fR as the name of an \s-1XML\s0 file containing
a top-level <disk> element describing the destination, must be present.
Additionally, if \fIdest\fR is given, \fIformat\fR should be specified to declare
the format of the destination (if \fIformat\fR is omitted, then libvirt
will reuse the format of the source, or with \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR will
be forced to probe the destination format, which could be a potential
security hole).  The command supports \fI\-\-raw\fR as a boolean flag synonym for
\&\fI\-\-format=raw\fR.  When using \fIdest\fR, the destination is treated as a regular
file unless \fI\-\-blockdev\fR is used to signal that it is a block device. By
default, this command flattens the entire chain; but if \fI\-\-shallow\fR is
specified, the copy shares the backing chain.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR is specified, then the destination must exist and have
sufficient space to hold the copy. If \fI\-\-shallow\fR is used in
conjunction with \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR then the pre-created image must have
guest visible contents identical to guest visible contents of the backing
file of the original image. This may be used to modify the backing file
names on the destination.
.Sp
By default, the copy job runs in the background, and consists of two
phases.  Initially, the job must copy all data from the source, and
during this phase, the job can only be canceled to revert back to the
source disk, with no guarantees about the destination.  After this phase
completes, both the source and the destination remain mirrored until a
call to \fBblockjob\fR with the \fI\-\-abort\fR and \fI\-\-pivot\fR flags pivots over
to the copy, or a call without \fI\-\-pivot\fR leaves the destination as a
faithful copy of that point in time.  However, if \fI\-\-wait\fR is specified,
then this command will block until the mirroring phase begins, or cancel
the operation if the optional \fItimeout\fR in seconds elapses or \s-1SIGINT\s0 is
sent (usually with \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl\-C\*(C'\fR).  Using \fI\-\-verbose\fR along with \fI\-\-wait\fR
will produce periodic status updates.  Using \fI\-\-pivot\fR (similar to
\&\fBblockjob\fR \fI\-\-pivot\fR) or \fI\-\-finish\fR (similar to \fBblockjob\fR \fI\-\-abort\fR)
implies \fI\-\-wait\fR, and will additionally end the job cleanly rather than
leaving things in the mirroring phase.  If job cancellation is triggered
by timeout or by \fI\-\-finish\fR, \fI\-\-async\fR will return control to the user
as fast as possible, otherwise the command may continue to block a little
while longer until the job has actually cancelled.
.Sp
\&\fIpath\fR specifies fully-qualified path of the disk.
\&\fIbandwidth\fR specifies copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s. Specifying a negative
value is interpreted as an unsigned long long value that might be essentially
unlimited, but more likely would overflow; it is safer to use 0 for that
purpose.  Specifying \fIgranularity\fR allows fine-tuning of the granularity that
will be copied when a dirty region is detected; larger values trigger less
I/O overhead but may end up copying more data overall (the default value is
usually correct); this value must be a power of two.  Specifying \fIbuf-size\fR
will control how much data can be simultaneously in-flight during the copy;
larger values use more memory but may allow faster completion (the default
value is usually correct).

Populate a disk from its backing image chain. By default, this command
flattens the entire chain; but if \fIbase\fR is specified, containing the
name of one of the backing files in the chain, then that file becomes
the new backing file and only the intermediate portion of the chain is
pulled.  Once all requested data from the backing image chain has been
pulled, the disk no longer depends on that portion of the backing chain.

unsafe unless the disk images are stored on coherent clustered filesystem,

When \fImigrateuri\fR is not specified, libvirt will automatically determine the
hypervisor specific \s-1URI. \s0 Some hypervisors, including \s-1QEMU,\s0 have an optional
\&\*(L"migration_host\*(R" configuration parameter (useful when the host has multiple
network interfaces).  If this is unspecified, libvirt determines a name
by looking up the target host's configured hostname.
.Sp
There are a few scenarios where specifying \fImigrateuri\fR may help:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The configured hostname is incorrect, or \s-1DNS\s0 is broken.  If a host has a
hostname which will not resolve to match one of its public \s-1IP\s0 addresses, then
libvirt will generate an incorrect \s-1URI. \s0 In this case \fImigrateuri\fR should be
explicitly specified, using an \s-1IP\s0 address, or a correct hostname.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The host has multiple network interfaces.  If a host has multiple network
interfaces, it might be desirable for the migration data stream to be sent over
a specific interface for either security or performance reasons.  In this case
\&\fImigrateuri\fR should be explicitly specified, using an \s-1IP\s0 address associated
with the network to be used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The firewall restricts what ports are available.  When libvirt generates
a migration \s-1URI,\s0 it will pick a port number using hypervisor specific rules.
Some hypervisors only require a single port to be open in the firewalls, while
others require a whole range of port numbers.  In the latter case \fImigrateuri\fR
might be specified to choose a specific port number outside the default range in
order to comply with local firewall policies.

Optional \fIgraphicsuri\fR overrides connection parameters used for automatically
reconnecting a graphical clients at the end of migration. If omitted, libvirt
will compute the parameters based on target host \s-1IP\s0 address. In case the
client does not have a direct access to the network virtualization hosts are
connected to and needs to connect through a proxy, \fIgraphicsuri\fR may be used
to specify the address the client should connect to. The \s-1URI\s0 is formed as
follows:

Optional \fIlisten-address\fR sets the listen address that hypervisor on the
destination side should bind to for incoming migration. Both IPv4 and IPv6

Undefine a domain. If the domain is running, this converts it to a
transient domain, without stopping it. If the domain is inactive,
the domain configuration is removed.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-managed\-save\fR flag guarantees that any managed save image (see
the \fBmanagedsave\fR command) is also cleaned up.  Without the flag, attempts
to undefine a domain with a managed save image will fail.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-snapshots\-metadata\fR flag guarantees that any snapshots (see the
\&\fBsnapshot-list\fR command) are also cleaned up when undefining an inactive
domain.  Without the flag, attempts to undefine an inactive domain with
snapshot metadata will fail.  If the domain is active, this flag is
ignored.

The \fI\-\-nvram\fR flag ensures no nvram (/domain/os/nvram/) file is
left behind. If the domain has an nvram file and the flag is
omitted, the undefine will fail.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-storage\fR flag takes a parameter \fBvolumes\fR, which is a comma separated
list of volume target names or source paths of storage volumes to be removed
along with the undefined domain. Volumes can be undefined and thus removed only
on inactive domains. Volume deletion is only attempted after the domain is
undefined; if not all of the requested volumes could be deleted, the
error message indicates what still remains behind. If a volume path is not
found in the domain definition, it's treated as if the volume was successfully
deleted. Only volumes managed by libvirt in storage pools can be removed this
way.
(See \fBdomblklist\fR for list of target names associated to a domain).
Example: \-\-storage vda,/path/to/storage.img
.Sp
The \fI\-\-remove\-all\-storage\fR flag specifies that all of the domain's storage
volumes should be deleted.

called at the right points (currently, qemu does this for \s-1PCI\s0 devices,
but not \s-1USB\s0).  If a device is not marked as managed, then it must
manually be detached before guests can use it, and manually reattached
to be returned to the host.  Also, if a device is manually detached,
then the host does not regain control of the device without a matching
reattach, even if the guests use the device in managed mode.
.IP "\fBnodedev-create\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-create FILE"
Create a device on the host node that can then be assigned to virtual
machines. Normally, libvirt is able to automatically determine which
host nodes are available for use, but this allows registration of
host hardware that libvirt did not automatically detect.  \fIfile\fR
contains xml for a top-level <device> description of a node device.
.IP "\fBnodedev-destroy\fR \fIdevice\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-destroy device"
Destroy (stop) a device on the host. \fIdevice\fR can be either device
name or wwn pair in \*(L"wwnn,wwpn\*(R" format (only works for vHBA currently).
Note that this makes libvirt quit managing a host device, and may even
make that device unusable by the rest of the physical host until a reboot.
.IP "\fBnodedev-detach\fR \fInodedev\fR [\fI\-\-driver backend_driver\fR]" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-detach nodedev [--driver backend_driver]"
Detach \fInodedev\fR from the host, so that it can safely be used by
guests via <hostdev> passthrough.  This is reversed with
\&\fBnodedev-reattach\fR, and is done automatically for managed devices.
For compatibility purposes, this command can also be spelled
\&\fBnodedev-dettach\fR.
.Sp
Different backend drivers expect the device to be bound to different
dummy devices. For example, \s-1QEMU\s0's \*(L"kvm\*(R" backend driver (the default)
expects the device to be bound to pci-stub, but its \*(L"vfio\*(R" backend
driver expects the device to be bound to vfio-pci. The \fI\-\-driver\fR
parameter can be used to specify the desired backend driver.
.IP "\fBnodedev-dumpxml\fR \fIdevice\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-dumpxml device"
Dump a <device> \s-1XML\s0 representation for the given node device, including
such information as the device name, which bus owns the device, the
vendor and product id, and any capabilities of the device usable by
libvirt (such as whether device reset is supported). \fIdevice\fR can
be either device name or wwn pair in \*(L"wwnn,wwpn\*(R" format (only works
for \s-1HBA\s0).
.IP "\fBnodedev-list\fR \fIcap\fR \fI\-\-tree\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-list cap --tree"
List all of the devices available on the node that are known by libvirt.
\&\fIcap\fR is used to filter the list by capability types, the types must be
separated by comma, e.g. \-\-cap pci,scsi, valid capability types include
\&'system', 'pci', 'usb_device', 'usb', 'net', 'scsi_host', 'scsi_target',
\&'scsi', 'storage', 'fc_host', 'vports', 'scsi_generic'. If \fI\-\-tree\fR is
used, the output is formatted in a tree representing parents of each node.
\&\fIcap\fR and \fI\-\-tree\fR are mutually exclusive.
.IP "\fBnodedev-reattach\fR \fInodedev\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-reattach nodedev"
Declare that \fInodedev\fR is no longer in use by any guests, and that
the host can resume normal use of the device.  This is done
automatically for devices in managed mode, but must be done explicitly
to match any explicit \fBnodedev-detach\fR.
.IP "\fBnodedev-reset\fR \fInodedev\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-reset nodedev"
Trigger a device reset for \fInodedev\fR, useful prior to transferring
a node device between guest passthrough or the host.  Libvirt will
often do this action implicitly when required, but this command
allows an explicit reset when needed.
.SH "VIRTUAL NETWORK COMMANDS"
.IX Header "VIRTUAL NETWORK COMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate networks. Libvirt has the capability to
define virtual networks which can then be used by domains and linked to
actual network devices. For more detailed information about this feature
see the documentation at <http://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html> . Many
of the commands for virtual networks are similar to the ones used for domains,
but the way to name a virtual network is either by its name or \s-1UUID.\s0
.IP "\fBnet-autostart\fR \fInetwork\fR [\fI\-\-disable\fR]" 4
.IX Item "net-autostart network [--disable]"
Configure a virtual network to be automatically started at boot.
The \fI\-\-disable\fR option disable autostarting.
.IP "\fBnet-create\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-create file"
Create a transient (temporary) virtual network from an
\&\s-1XML \s0\fIfile\fR and instantiate (start) the network.
See the documentation at <http://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html>
to get a description of the \s-1XML\s0 network format used by libvirt.
.IP "\fBnet-define\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-define file"
Define a persistent virtual network from an \s-1XML \s0\fIfile\fR, the network is just
defined but not instantiated (started).
.IP "\fBnet-destroy\fR \fInetwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-destroy network"
Destroy (stop) a given transient or persistent virtual network
specified by its name or \s-1UUID.\s0 This takes effect immediately.
.IP "\fBnet-dumpxml\fR \fInetwork\fR [\fI\-\-inactive\fR]" 4
.IX Item "net-dumpxml network [--inactive]"
Output the virtual network information as an \s-1XML\s0 dump to stdout.
If \fI\-\-inactive\fR is specified, then physical functions are not
expanded into their associated virtual functions.
.IP "\fBnet-edit\fR \fInetwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-edit network"
Edit the \s-1XML\s0 configuration file for a network.
.Sp
This is equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& virsh net\-dumpxml \-\-inactive network > network.xml
\& vi network.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)

.Ve
.Sp
except that it does some error checking.
.Sp
The editor used can be supplied by the \f(CW$VISUAL\fR or \f(CW$EDITOR\fR environment
variables, and defaults to \f(CW\*(C`vi\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBnet-event\fR {[\fInetwork\fR] \fIevent\fR [\fI\-\-loop\fR] [\fI\-\-timeout\fR \fIseconds\fR] | \fI\-\-list\fR}" 4
.IX Item "net-event {[network] event [--loop] [--timeout seconds] | --list}"
Wait for a class of network events to occur, and print appropriate details
of events as they happen.  The events can optionally be filtered by
\&\fInetwork\fR.  Using \fI\-\-list\fR as the only argument will provide a list
of possible \fIevent\fR values known by this client, although the connection
might not allow registering for all these events.
.Sp
By default, this command is one-shot, and returns success once an event
occurs; you can send \s-1SIGINT \s0(usually via \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl\-C\*(C'\fR) to quit immediately.
If \fI\-\-timeout\fR is specified, the command gives up waiting for events
after \fIseconds\fR have elapsed.   With \fI\-\-loop\fR, the command prints all
events until a timeout or interrupt key.
.IP "\fBnet-info\fR \fInetwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-info network"
Returns basic information about the \fInetwork\fR object.

.IX Item "net-list [--inactive | --all] [--persistent] [<--transient>] [--autostart] [<--no-autostart>]"
Returns the list of active networks, if \fI\-\-all\fR is specified this will also
include defined but inactive networks, if \fI\-\-inactive\fR is specified only the
inactive ones will be listed. You may also want to filter the returned networks
by \fI\-\-persistent\fR to list the persistent ones, \fI\-\-transient\fR to list the
transient ones, \fI\-\-autostart\fR to list the ones with autostart enabled, and
\&\fI\-\-no\-autostart\fR to list the ones with autostart disabled.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of
\&\s-1API\s0 calls with an inherent race, where a pool might not be listed or might appear
more than once if it changed state between calls while the list was being
collected.  Newer servers do not have this problem.
.IP "\fBnet-name\fR \fInetwork-UUID\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-name network-UUID"
Convert a network \s-1UUID\s0 to network name.

destroy and re-start the network.
.Sp
\&\fIcommand\fR is one of \*(L"add-first\*(R", \*(L"add-last\*(R", \*(L"add\*(R" (a synonym for
add-last), \*(L"delete\*(R", or \*(L"modify\*(R".
.Sp
\&\fIsection\fR is one of \*(L"bridge\*(R", \*(L"domain\*(R", \*(L"ip\*(R", \*(L"ip-dhcp-host\*(R",
\&\*(L"ip-dhcp-range\*(R", \*(L"forward\*(R", \*(L"forward-interface\*(R", \*(L"forward-pf\*(R",
\&\*(L"portgroup\*(R", \*(L"dns-host\*(R", \*(L"dns-txt\*(R", or \*(L"dns-srv\*(R", each section being
named by a concatenation of the xml element hierarchy leading to the
element being changed. For example, \*(L"ip-dhcp-host\*(R" will change a
<host> element that is contained inside a <dhcp> element inside an
<ip> element of the network.
.Sp
\&\fIxml\fR is either the text of a complete xml element of the type being
changed (e.g. \*(L"<host mac=\*(R"00:11:22:33:44:55' ip='1.2.3.4'/>\*(L", or the
name of a file that contains a complete xml element. Disambiguation is
done by looking at the first character of the provided text \- if the
first character is \*(R"<\*(L", it is xml text, if the first character is not
\&\*(R"<", it is the name of a file that contains the xml text to be used.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-parent\-index\fR option is used to specify which of several
parent elements the requested element is in (0\-based). For example, a
dhcp <host> element could be in any one of multiple <ip> elements in
the network; if a parent-index isn't provided, the \*(L"most appropriate\*(R"
<ip> element will be selected (usually the only one that already has a
<dhcp> element), but if \fI\-\-parent\-index\fR is given, that particular
instance of <ip> will get the modification.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-live\fR is specified, affect a running network.
If \fI\-\-config\fR is specified, affect the next startup of a persistent network.
If \fI\-\-current\fR is specified, affect the current network state.
Both \fI\-\-live\fR and \fI\-\-config\fR flags may be given, but \fI\-\-current\fR is

specified.
.SH "INTERFACE COMMANDS"
.IX Header "INTERFACE COMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate host interfaces.  Often, these host
interfaces can then be used by name within domain <interface> elements
(such as a system-created bridge interface), but there is no
requirement that host interfaces be tied to any particular guest
configuration \s-1XML\s0 at all.
.PP
Many of the commands for host interfaces are similar to the ones used
for domains, and the way to name an interface is either by its name or
its \s-1MAC\s0 address.  However, using a \s-1MAC\s0 address for an \fIiface\fR
argument only works when that address is unique (if an interface and a
bridge share the same \s-1MAC\s0 address, which is often the case, then using
that \s-1MAC\s0 address results in an error due to ambiguity, and you must
resort to a name instead).
.IP "\fBiface-bridge\fR \fIinterface\fR \fIbridge\fR [\fI\-\-no\-stp\fR] [\fIdelay\fR] [\fI\-\-no\-start\fR]" 4
.IX Item "iface-bridge interface bridge [--no-stp] [delay] [--no-start]"
Create a bridge device named \fIbridge\fR, and attach the existing
network device \fIinterface\fR to the new bridge.  The new bridge
defaults to starting immediately, with \s-1STP\s0 enabled and a delay of 0;
these settings can be altered with \fI\-\-no\-stp\fR, \fI\-\-no\-start\fR, and an
integer number of seconds for \fIdelay\fR. All \s-1IP\s0 address configuration
of \fIinterface\fR will be moved to the new bridge device.

.IP "\fBiface-name\fR \fIinterface\fR" 4
.IX Item "iface-name interface"
Convert a host interface \s-1MAC\s0 to interface name, if the \s-1MAC\s0 address is unique
among the host's interfaces.

.IX Item "iface-unbridge bridge [--no-start]"
Tear down a bridge device named \fIbridge\fR, releasing its underlying
interface back to normal usage, and moving all \s-1IP\s0 address
configuration from the bridge device to the underlying device.  The
underlying interface is restarted unless \fI\-\-no\-start\fR is present;
this flag is present for symmetry, but generally not recommended.
.Sp
See also \fBiface-bridge\fR for creating a bridge.
.IP "\fBiface-undefine\fR \fIinterface\fR" 4
.IX Item "iface-undefine interface"
Undefine the configuration for an inactive host interface.
.IP "\fBiface-begin\fR" 4
.IX Item "iface-begin"
Create a snapshot of current host interface settings, which can later
be committed (\fIiface-commit\fR) or restored (\fIiface-rollback\fR).  If a
snapshot already exists, then this command will fail until the
previous snapshot has been committed or restored.  Undefined behavior
results if any external changes are made to host interfaces outside of
the libvirt \s-1API\s0 between the beginning of a snapshot and its eventual
commit or rollback.
.IP "\fBiface-commit\fR" 4
.IX Item "iface-commit"
Declare all changes since the last \fIiface-begin\fR as working, and
delete the rollback point.  If no interface snapshot has already been
started, then this command will fail.
.IP "\fBiface-rollback\fR" 4
.IX Item "iface-rollback"
Revert all host interface settings back to the state recorded in the
last \fIiface-begin\fR.  If no interface snapshot has already been
started, then this command will fail.  Rebooting the host also serves
as an implicit rollback point.
.SH "STORAGE POOL COMMANDS"
.IX Header "STORAGE POOL COMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate storage pools. Libvirt has the

Build a given pool.
.Sp
Options \fI\-\-overwrite\fR and \fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fR can only be used for
\&\fBpool-build\fR a filesystem or disk pool. For a file system pool if
neither of them is specified, \fBpool-build\fR makes the directory. If
\&\fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fR is specified, it probes to determine if a
filesystem already exists on the target device, returning an error
if exists, or using mkfs to format the target device if not. If
\&\fI\-\-overwrite\fR is specified, mkfs is always executed and any existing
data on the target device is overwritten unconditionally. For a disk
pool, if neither of them is specified or \fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fR is specified,
\&\fBpool-build\fR will use 'parted \-\-print' in order to determine if the
disk already has a label before attempting to create one. Only if a disk
does not already have one will a label be created. If \fI\-\-overwrite\fR is
specified or it's been determined that the disk doesn't already have one,

.SH "SNAPSHOT COMMANDS"
.IX Header "SNAPSHOT COMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate domain snapshots.  Snapshots take the
disk, memory, and device state of a domain at a point-of-time, and save it
for future use.  They have many uses, from saving a \*(L"clean\*(R" copy of an \s-1OS\s0
image to saving a domain's state before a potentially destructive operation.
Snapshots are identified with a unique name.  See
<http://libvirt.org/formatsnapshot.html> for documentation of the \s-1XML\s0 format
used to represent properties of snapshots.
.IP "\fBsnapshot-create\fR \fIdomain\fR [\fIxmlfile\fR] {[\fI\-\-redefine\fR [\fI\-\-current\fR]] | [\fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR] [\fI\-\-halt\fR] [\fI\-\-disk\-only\fR] [\fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR] [\fI\-\-quiesce\fR] [\fI\-\-atomic\fR] [\fI\-\-live\fR]}" 4
.IX Item "snapshot-create domain [xmlfile] {[--redefine [--current]] | [--no-metadata] [--halt] [--disk-only] [--reuse-external] [--quiesce] [--atomic] [--live]}"
Create a snapshot for domain \fIdomain\fR with the properties specified in
\&\fIxmlfile\fR.  Normally, the only properties settable for a domain snapshot
are the <name> and <description> elements, as well as <disks> if
\&\fI\-\-disk\-only\fR is given; the rest of the fields are
ignored, and automatically filled in by libvirt.  If \fIxmlfile\fR is
completely omitted, then libvirt will choose a value for all fields.
The new snapshot will become current, as listed by \fBsnapshot-current\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-halt\fR is specified, the domain will be left in an inactive state
after the snapshot is created.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR is specified, the snapshot will only include disk
state rather than the usual system checkpoint with vm state.  Disk
snapshots are faster than full system checkpoints, but reverting to a
disk snapshot may require fsck or journal replays, since it is like
the disk state at the point when the power cord is abruptly pulled;
and mixing \fI\-\-halt\fR and \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR loses any data that was not
flushed to disk at the time.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-redefine\fR is specified, then all \s-1XML\s0 elements produced by
\&\fBsnapshot-dumpxml\fR are valid; this can be used to migrate snapshot
hierarchy from one machine to another, to recreate hierarchy for the
case of a transient domain that goes away and is later recreated with
the same name and \s-1UUID,\s0 or to make slight alterations in the snapshot
metadata (such as host-specific aspects of the domain \s-1XML\s0 embedded in
the snapshot).  When this flag is supplied, the \fIxmlfile\fR argument
is mandatory, and the domain's current snapshot will not be altered
unless the \fI\-\-current\fR flag is also given.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR is specified, then the snapshot data is created,
but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not
treat the snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot
unless \fI\-\-redefine\fR is later used to teach libvirt about the
metadata again).
.Sp
If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR is specified, and the snapshot \s-1XML\s0 requests an
external snapshot with a destination of an existing file, then the
destination must exist and be pre-created with correct format and
metadata. The file is then reused; otherwise, a snapshot is refused
to avoid losing contents of the existing files.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-quiesce\fR is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent
to freeze and unfreeze domain's mounted file systems. However,
if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation will fail.
Currently, this requires \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR to be passed as well.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-atomic\fR is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot
either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support
this.  If this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail
after partially performing the action, and \fBdumpxml\fR must be used to
see whether any partial changes occurred.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-live\fR is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while the guest is
running. This increases the size of the memory image of the external
checkpoint. This is currently supported only for external checkpoints.
.Sp
Existence of snapshot metadata will prevent attempts to \fBundefine\fR
a persistent domain.  However, for transient domains, snapshot
metadata is silently lost when the domain quits running (whether
by command such as \fBdestroy\fR or by internal guest action).

Create a snapshot for domain \fIdomain\fR with the given <name> and
<description>; if either value is omitted, libvirt will choose a
value.  If \fI\-\-print\-xml\fR is specified, then \s-1XML\s0 appropriate for
\&\fIsnapshot-create\fR is output, rather than actually creating a snapshot.
Otherwise, if \fI\-\-halt\fR is specified, the domain will be left in an
inactive state after the snapshot is created, and if \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR
is specified, the snapshot will not include vm state.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-memspec\fR option can be used to control whether a checkpoint
is internal or external.  The \fI\-\-memspec\fR flag is mandatory, followed
by a \fBmemspec\fR of the form \fB[file=]name[,snapshot=type]\fR, where
type can be \fBno\fR, \fBinternal\fR, or \fBexternal\fR.  To include a literal
comma in \fBfile=name\fR, escape it with a second comma. \fI\-\-memspec\fR cannot
be used together with \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-diskspec\fR option can be used to control how \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR and
external checkpoints create external files.  This option can occur
multiple times, according to the number of <disk> elements in the domain
xml.  Each <diskspec> is in the
form \fBdisk[,snapshot=type][,driver=type][,file=name]\fR.  A \fIdiskspec\fR
must be provided for disks backed by block devices as libvirt doesn't
auto-generate file names for those.  To include a
literal comma in \fBdisk\fR or in \fBfile=name\fR, escape it with a second
comma.  A literal \fI\-\-diskspec\fR must precede each \fBdiskspec\fR unless
all three of \fIdomain\fR, \fIname\fR, and \fIdescription\fR are also present.
For example, a diskspec of \*(L"vda,snapshot=external,file=/path/to,,new\*(R"
results in the following \s-1XML:
 \s0 <disk name='vda' snapshot='external'>
    <source file='/path/to,new'/>
  </disk>
.Sp
If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR is specified, and the domain \s-1XML\s0 or \fIdiskspec\fR
option requests an external snapshot with a destination of an existing
file, then the destination must exist and be pre-created with correct
format and metadata. The file is then reused; otherwise, a snapshot
is refused to avoid losing contents of the existing files.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-quiesce\fR is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent
to freeze and unfreeze domain's mounted file systems. However,
if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation will fail.
Currently, this requires \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR to be passed as well.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR is specified, then the snapshot data is created,
but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not
treat the snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot
unless \fBsnapshot-create\fR is later used to teach libvirt about the
metadata again).  This flag is incompatible with \fI\-\-print\-xml\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-atomic\fR is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot
either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support
this.  If this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail
after partially performing the action, and \fBdumpxml\fR must be used to
see whether any partial changes occurred.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-live\fR is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while the guest is
running. This increases the size of the memory image of the external
checkpoint. This is currently supported only for external checkpoints.

Without \fIsnapshotname\fR, this will output the snapshot \s-1XML\s0 for the domain's
current snapshot (if any).  If \fI\-\-name\fR is specified, just the
current snapshot name instead of the full xml.  Otherwise, using
\&\fI\-\-security\-info\fR will also include security sensitive information in
the \s-1XML.\s0
.Sp
With \fIsnapshotname\fR, this is a request to make the existing named
snapshot become the current snapshot, without reverting the domain.
.IP "\fBsnapshot-edit\fR \fIdomain\fR [\fIsnapshotname\fR] [\fI\-\-current\fR] {[\fI\-\-rename\fR] | [\fI\-\-clone\fR]}" 4
.IX Item "snapshot-edit domain [snapshotname] [--current] {[--rename] | [--clone]}"
Edit the \s-1XML\s0 configuration file for \fIsnapshotname\fR of a domain.  If
both \fIsnapshotname\fR and \fI\-\-current\fR are specified, also force the
edited snapshot to become the current snapshot.  If \fIsnapshotname\fR
is omitted, then \fI\-\-current\fR must be supplied, to edit the current
snapshot.
.Sp
This is equivalent to:
.Sp

The editor used can be supplied by the \f(CW$VISUAL\fR or \f(CW$EDITOR\fR environment
variables, and defaults to \f(CW\*(C`vi\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-rename\fR is specified, then the edits can change the snapshot
name.  If \fI\-\-clone\fR is specified, then changing the snapshot name
will create a clone of the snapshot metadata.  If neither is specified,
then the edits must not change the snapshot name.  Note that changing
a snapshot name must be done with care, since the contents of some
snapshots, such as internal snapshots within a single qcow2 file, are
accessible only from the original name.

List all of the available snapshots for the given domain, defaulting
to show columns for the snapshot name, creation time, and domain state.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-parent\fR is specified, add a column to the output table giving
the name of the parent of each snapshot.  If \fI\-\-roots\fR is specified,
the list will be filtered to just snapshots that have no parents.
If \fI\-\-tree\fR is specified, the output will be in a tree format, listing
just snapshot names.  These three options are mutually exclusive. If
\&\fI\-\-name\fR is specified only the snapshot name is printed. This option is
mutually exclusive with \fI\-\-tree\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-from\fR is provided, filter the list to snapshots which are
children of the given \fBsnapshot\fR; or if \fI\-\-current\fR is provided,
start at the current snapshot.  When used in isolation or with
\&\fI\-\-parent\fR, the list is limited to direct children unless
\&\fI\-\-descendants\fR is also present.  When used with \fI\-\-tree\fR, the
use of \fI\-\-descendants\fR is implied.  This option is not compatible
with \fI\-\-roots\fR.  Note that the starting point of \fI\-\-from\fR or
\&\fI\-\-current\fR is not included in the list unless the \fI\-\-tree\fR
option is also present.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-leaves\fR is specified, the list will be filtered to just
snapshots that have no children.  Likewise, if \fI\-\-no\-leaves\fR is
specified, the list will be filtered to just snapshots with
children.  (Note that omitting both options does no filtering,
while providing both options will either produce the same list
or error out depending on whether the server recognizes the flags).
Filtering options are not compatible with \fI\-\-tree\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-metadata\fR is specified, the list will be filtered to just
snapshots that involve libvirt metadata, and thus would prevent
\&\fBundefine\fR of a persistent domain, or be lost on \fBdestroy\fR of
a transient domain.  Likewise, if \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR is specified,
the list will be filtered to just snapshots that exist without
the need for libvirt metadata.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-inactive\fR is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots
that were taken when the domain was shut off.  If \fI\-\-active\fR is
specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that were taken
when the domain was running, and where the snapshot includes the
memory state to revert to that running state.  If \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR is
specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that were taken
when the domain was running, but where the snapshot includes only
disk state.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-internal\fR is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots
that use internal storage of existing disk images.  If \fI\-\-external\fR
is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that use external
files for disk images or memory state.
.IP "\fBsnapshot-dumpxml\fR \fIdomain\fR \fIsnapshot\fR [\fI\-\-security\-info\fR]" 4

.IX Item "snapshot-revert domain {snapshot | --current} [{--running | --paused}] [--force]"
Revert the given domain to the snapshot specified by \fIsnapshot\fR, or to
the current snapshot with \fI\-\-current\fR.  Be aware
that this is a destructive action; any changes in the domain since the last
snapshot was taken will be lost.  Also note that the state of the domain after
snapshot-revert is complete will be the state of the domain at the time
the original snapshot was taken.
.Sp
Normally, reverting to a snapshot leaves the domain in the state it was
at the time the snapshot was created, except that a disk snapshot with
no vm state leaves the domain in an inactive state.  Passing either the
\&\fI\-\-running\fR or \fI\-\-paused\fR flag will perform additional state changes
(such as booting an inactive domain, or pausing a running domain).  Since
transient domains cannot be inactive, it is required to use one of these
flags when reverting to a disk snapshot of a transient domain.
.Sp
There are two cases where a snapshot revert involves extra risk, which
requires the use of \fI\-\-force\fR to proceed.  One is the case of a
snapshot that lacks full domain information for reverting
configuration (such as snapshots created prior to libvirt 0.9.5);
since libvirt cannot prove that the current configuration matches what
was in use at the time of the snapshot, supplying \fI\-\-force\fR assures
libvirt that the snapshot is compatible with the current configuration
(and if it is not, the domain will likely fail to run).  The other is
the case of reverting from a running domain to an active state where a
new hypervisor has to be created rather than reusing the existing
hypervisor, because it implies drawbacks such as breaking any existing
\&\s-1VNC\s0 or Spice connections; this condition happens with an active
snapshot that uses a provably incompatible configuration, as well as
with an inactive snapshot that is combined with the \fI\-\-start\fR or
\&\fI\-\-pause\fR flag.
.IP "\fBsnapshot-delete\fR \fIdomain\fR {\fIsnapshot\fR | \fI\-\-current\fR} [\fI\-\-metadata\fR] [{\fI\-\-children\fR | \fI\-\-children\-only\fR}]" 4
.IX Item "snapshot-delete domain {snapshot | --current} [--metadata] [{--children | --children-only}]"
Delete the snapshot for the domain named \fIsnapshot\fR, or the current
snapshot with \fI\-\-current\fR.  If this snapshot
has child snapshots, changes from this snapshot will be merged into the
children.  If \fI\-\-children\fR is passed, then delete this snapshot and any
children of this snapshot.  If \fI\-\-children\-only\fR is passed, then delete
any children of this snapshot, but leave this snapshot intact.  These
two flags are mutually exclusive.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-metadata\fR is specified, then only delete the snapshot metadata
maintained by libvirt, while leaving the snapshot contents intact for
access by external tools; otherwise deleting a snapshot also removes
the data contents from that point in time.

used via \fIqemu-monitor-command\fR to learn what events are supported.
If \fI\-\-regex\fR is used, \fIevent-name\fR is a basic regular expression
